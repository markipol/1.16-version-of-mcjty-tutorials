This contains code for 1.16.5 versions, with the official mojang mappings instead of MCP, of McJty tutorials. 

Currently there is the FirstBlock tutorial.

Maybe I will put some other unrelated stuff in as well. 

The only thing majorly different is registration. I don't do it in one file, I do it by different types (TileEntityTypesInit,BlockInit,ContainerTypeInit,etc.)

Hope this helps people!
